CiviCRM Light 2014 theme
========================

This is an unofficial theme for a CiviCRM subsite.

It was developed for the experimental CiviCRM FR site (http://www.civicrmfr.org),
but we tried to keep it generic enough so that it could be re-used elsewhere.

For more information, see:

Installation
------------

- Fork on github
- Clone your fork into your sites/example.org/ directory.
- Enable the theme, modules, etc. (TODO: make a feature/other to enable with dependancies).
- Adapt to your needs. Commit back to your fork, but try to merge back improvements that
  could be useful to other subsites by making a pull request on github.
